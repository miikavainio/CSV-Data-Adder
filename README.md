# CSV-Data-Adder  

I created this project to make it easier to add data from ice hockey games into CSV files. This way it is more user friendly and saves time for me in future projects. Later I will use the collected data to create analysis based off it.  
  
Adding information to CSV file w/ Python &amp; tkinter

## Progress

First creating the window with tkinter and adjusting it the way I want

Then added the input fields.  
The code will be edited in the future, so I will not show the current code

Next, I will modify the status field to be clearer.  
Regulation/Shootout/Ovetime will be options to choose from.  
Regulation as a standard since it is clearly the most used option.
